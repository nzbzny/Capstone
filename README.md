# Capstone Project
Using machine learning to create a behavioral Intrusion Detection System. Data is being collected from a honeypot running Cowrie, which was branched off of Kippo.
Currently the data collection and data parsing code is in C++, the machine learning code is in Python, and there is a script written in VBA to infill missing values, but that will eventually be converted to a different language so it doesn't need to be manually run by the user if there is time remaining before the year ends.
